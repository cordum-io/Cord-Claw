# CordClaw attack classes

This page tracks OpenClaw attack classes closed by CordClaw hardening work.
The strategic roadmap is `C:\Users\yaron\.claude\plans\we-need-cordclaw-to-jiggly-forest.md`; this entry covers Phase 1 step 2.

## Prompt-level PII leakage

**Attack.** An agent reads context that includes credentials, such as a
`config.json` containing API keys, and quotes those credentials into the prompt
sent to OpenAI, Anthropic, or another model provider. Before task-341c3570,
CordClaw intercepted tool calls but not the assembled prompt, so secrets could
land in provider request logs.

**Mitigation.** The plugin now registers `before_prompt_build`, extracts the
assembled prompt text, and sends a prompt-build envelope to the daemon `/check`
endpoint before the provider call. The daemon scans the prompt with the
`prompt_pii_redact` primitive from `pack/policies/openclaw-safety.yaml` (or the
built-in fallback policy) and returns:

- `ALLOW` for prompts without matches.
- `CONSTRAIN` with `constraints.kind=prompt_redact` and a deterministic
  `modified_prompt` containing `<REDACTED-...>` placeholders.
- `DENY` for block-mode policies or oversized prompts.

The plugin fails closed for this hook: if the daemon is unreachable, OpenClaw
receives `cordclaw.prompt.dlp_block` and the prompt is not sent to the model.

**Default patterns.** The shipped primitive covers OpenAI-style keys, Slack bot
tokens, AWS access key IDs, context-guarded AWS secret values, and GitHub tokens.
Email redaction is opt-in through `include_email` so deployments can choose the
right balance between privacy and false positives.

**Operational notes.**

- Configure `CORDCLAW_DLP_POLICY_PATH` to point the daemon at the pack policy
  file when running outside the packaged deployment.
- Redaction is deterministic; identical input and policy produce byte-identical
  output, keeping prompt-build cache behavior stable.
- Logs and audit entries record hook, decision, match count, and pattern names
  only. They never include prompt text or matched literal values.

**Verification.**

- `daemon/test/integration/prompt_redaction_test.go` seeds a fake secret
  `sk-TESTKEY-DONTLEAK` and asserts no captured request body for
  `api.openai.com` or `api.anthropic.com` contains the literal.
- `daemon/internal/redact/dlp_fp_corpus_test.go` enforces a false-positive rate
  no higher than 0.5% across the benign prompt corpus.
